# ESP32 Wireless IoT System with OLED Display  

This project implements a wireless communication system using ESP-NOW protocol between two ESP32 modules. It collects environmental data from sensors and displays it on an OLED screen, demonstrating efficient and real-time IoT data exchange.  

## Features  
- **Wireless Communication**: Utilizes ESP-NOW for fast and reliable peer-to-peer communication.  
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Reads temperature, humidity, and light intensity using DHT11 and LDR sensors.  
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Displays sensor data on a 128x64 OLED screen using Adafruit SSD1306 libraries.  

## Components  
- ESP32 Dev Boards (x2)  
- DHT11 Sensor  
- LDR Sensor  
- 128x64 OLED Display  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:
